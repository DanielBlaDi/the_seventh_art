## 📖 Project Description  
In today’s context of increasing digitalization, sedentary lifestyles have become a significant health issue. The gym has emerged as a popular alternative to counter this problem, but many beginners face major barriers: on the one hand, the difficulty of identifying and correctly performing exercises, combined with the limited personalized attention that instructors sometimes provide; on the other hand, the lack of motivation due to not having a clear record of progress made.  

To address these needs, Rocky emerges as an application designed to support those who wish to start at the gym without prior experience. The app will allow users to easily track weights, repetitions, and routines, giving them a clear view of their progress and thereby strengthening their motivation.  

Unlike other solutions available on the market, Rocky aims to stand out through the integration of artificial intelligence, capable of recommending exercises and personalized adjustments based on user performance, along with a user-friendly and attractive interface that facilitates continuous interaction with the application.
